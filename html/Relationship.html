        <h1>What is love?</h1>
<p class="paragraph">
    Some people may think that love is compose of 2 person which is a man and a woman. Thats the biggest misconception that peoples are thinking,
    and some people may not be aware about it. Love is like a relation on something or somebody, Love is unconditional it can be learn but difficult to forget,
    likewise as relation when your using your phone as usual it's called relation between you and a phone, Further examples. such as Stuffs,
    Things, Human, Nature, Beliefs, Culture, Activities, Promises, And, Etc. This is the types of relation same goes to Love. Love.
    Loving your Own SELF, Family, God, Peoples, and etc.
    <br><br>
    Love refers to a deep connection on somebody. If we are loving somebody we know that they are, reliable, crucial, candid. polite. And etc.
    But before we proceed, Lets divide the topic onto 3, Such as, What is love. How a Person develope a love towards a Somebody, Why many people lost the Love to somebody,
    And, How does love function.
    <br><br>
    A sample Scenario;
    How does love is being develope, Imagine your in  a situation that you feel despair. i'm going to make a 2 fictional characters. which is Vrill and Althea.
    Althea is a woman and Vrill is a man,<br><br>
     Imagine althea was in the middle of despair because of the challenges of life she's facing, althought she tried her best all the time she often to fail.
     Here's the main part of the story. Althea's Examination is imminent, before the examination she reviewed, did a practice,And, echanced her memories.   
     If we can describe Althea, she is. Beautiful, Polite, Diligent, Emphathy, compassionate, Candid, And Definitely Unique that it seem's you would never find a girl like her again.
     althea, has a dream of becoming a Nurse. Even though, she's facing so many challenges of life she still pursuing her dream, she knows that this is only
     way to give her parents a beautifl life. lets go futher deep about althea's background, Althea was born in 2010 month of october 2th day,
     she was born in poor family, She often sleep without eating a dinner,Around her there are many youth and toddler was being sick because of poor environment,
     So her dream to be a doctor come's in. She wants to become a doctor in the future to help people to treat them for free, Because she already experienced
     that many doctors often to treat a person who has a money rather than a poor people who seek for a help. Because of her emphaty and sympathy towards peoples
     thats made her to think that she really wants to help peoples either poor or rich with same treatment equally. And her dream to become a doctor come's in.
     Her determination to pursue her dreams will pay off in the future. That is what she often to think everytime she feels, Weak, Lonely, and Losing a Determination.
     Lets go back to the previous topic. Her examination is near, So after althea did everything, She felt that she might fail the exam. Because some of the questions
     is not relevant to the topic she reviewed. And now lets go on Vrill's background. 
     Lets describe vrill.
